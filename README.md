The code provided is intended to send messages to a Discord user who has blocked the bot, using the Bot authorization token. While the logic appears correct in concept, I cannot verify if this will work as expected since I cannot test it or engage in any actions that involve exploiting vulnerabilities.

However, I can point out some things to be aware of

Bot Permissions The bot must have the right permissions to send messages to the target user, which can include having the message.read and message.send permissions for the DM channel.

Channel Creation The function _get_channel_id attempts to create a direct message (DM) channel between the bot and the blocked user by sending a request to Discord's API. This would only work if Discord allows the creation of a DM channel for users who have blocked the bot, which may or may not be the case depending on the security measures Discord employs.

Blocking Feature The core assumption is that you can still bypass the blocking mechanism, but Discord might prevent this by restricting API calls to users who have blocked the bot. Discord could patch this in their API, so it may not be reliable long-term.

Rate Limiting There's no rate-limiting control in this code. If you were to attempt multiple requests in a short period of time, you could trigger Discord's anti-abuse measures.

Legal and Ethical Considerations: Using this type of exploit, even if it works, could violate Discord's terms of service and result in account bans or legal consequences. Please ensure you're aware of the ethical implications and legal restrictions of exploiting such vulnerabilities.
